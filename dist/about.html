            Now I don’t want to sound over the top buuut I am SO happy to have found Suzanne. She is friendly and completely gets what I’m after! After our first clean I walked around my house speechless!! She has de cluttered and cleaned more than I could have imagined. I am so grateful for how hard she has worked! Thank you!

            I was hesitant at using a relatively new service as Wizzy Mop at
            first. But I was pleasantly surprised by their 5 star service, it
            was truly impeccable and I cannot fault their enthusiasm in the
            slightest. Highly recommend to anyone with any size house (mines
            really big) Big Up x

            Amazing experience - Following a house move, the previous occupants
            had left it in a dire state so needed someone to do a purge clean
            ASAP and Whizzy Mops were more than willing to go out of their way
            to help me out. I’ve never seen anyone clean with such enthusiasm
            and energy as Suz. Highly recommend.

            Had two 3 hour ‘deep clean’ sessions booked. Wow what an amazing job
            and so friendly.....Thoroughly recommend. Give them a try, you wont
            be disappointed.
